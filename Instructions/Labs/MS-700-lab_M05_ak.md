```
Note : 
Please note that odl_userXXXXX@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com is your administrator user and you should use odl_userXXXXX@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com in place of MOD Administrator (admin@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com) throughout this lab
```

### **Exercise 1: Configure channel and message policies**

In this exercise you will configure policies to manage the creation of new private channels and the available tools for users in chat.

#### Task 1 - Create messaging policy for giphy, memes and stickers

In the past, some users of Contoso have used a lot of stickers, gif animations and similar pictures in their conversations, even with externals using other chat solutions. The new corporate guideline shall prohibit the use of graphic elements in corporate communication via Teams, because users shall not use them in conversations with external customers and clients. As a Teams service administrator, you must create a new message policy that prohibits its use and apply it to several users of your pilot project.

**Note:** After creating a messaging policy, it can take up to 24 hours for the settings to be applied to the users.

1. Connect to the Client 1 VM with the credentials that have been provided to you.

2. Open **Microsoft Edge**, maximize the window and navigate to the **Teams admin center** at [**https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/**](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/).

3. On the **Pick an account** page, select the **Joni Sherman** (JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com) and sign in with the provided credentials.

4. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Messaging policies**, then click on the **+ Add** at the right side of the page, to create a new messaging policy.

	- **Description**: Policy to disable giphys, stickers, and memes in conversations

	- **Use Giphys in conversations**: off

	- **Use Memes in conversations**: off

	- **Use Stickers in conversations**: off

6. Leave the rest of the settings as default. Select **Save**.

7. In the Messaging policies overview, select the checkmark left to **Regular users without fun stuff**. Then select **Manage users** in the top navigation pane. If you cannot see **Manage users**, you may need to select the three dots first.

8. Type in **Lynne Robbins** and select **Add**, and then select **Apply**.

9. Stay in the Teams admin center and continue with the next task.

In this task, you have successfully configured a new messaging policy and assigned it to Lynne Robbins. It will now take some time for the policy to take effect. Continue with the next task.
