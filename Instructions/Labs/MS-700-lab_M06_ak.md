## **Lab Setup**

- **Estimated Time:** 90 minutes.

## **Instructions**


```
Note : 
Please note that odl_userXXXXX@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com is your administrator user and you should use odl_userXXXXX@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com in place of MOD Administrator (admin@<YourTenant>.onmicrosoft.com) throughout this lab
```

#### Assign Teams Admin Roles to users

In this task, you will use the default global admin to login to the Microsoft 365 admin center and assign several teams admin roles to different users. This task is crucial for the following tasks and exercises because you will perform most of the tasks in context of Joni Sherman’s account.

1. Sign in to the **Microsoft 365 admin center** ([**https://admin.microsoft.com**](https://admin.microsoft.com/)) using **MOD Administrator** (admin@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com).
